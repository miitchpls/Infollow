# Infollow

If there's one thing I love to do, it's playing around and experimenting with APIs of popular services. In this case, I had a great time playing around with the (not exactly official üòÖ) Instagram APIs.

Infollow is an application coded in Angular and Express. Once you log in with your Instagram account through the APIs exposed by the [instagram-private-api](https://github.com/dilame/instagram-private-api) library, it lets you retrieve a list of users you follow but who don't reciprocate, like Britney Spears... (I've always hoped she'd follow back, argh üò§).

Born out of sheer curiosity, the project employs Angular for the frontend and the Tailwind CSS library for styling, where I had a great time trying out new things, such as the light or dark mode based on the system settings you've configured on your device üòÅ.

The backend, powered by Express.js, relies on the [instagram-private-api](https://github.com/dilame/instagram-private-api) library to interact with Instagram's services. It's a playful exploration turned into a functional project, combining Angular, Tailwind CSS, and Express.js to bring a bit of fun to the world of Instagram interactions.
